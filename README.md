# VideoCore Android Library 

*Because who needs WhatsApp when you can build your own video calling app and pretend you're Mark Zuckerberg?*

## What is this thing?

VideoCore is an Android library that makes WebRTC video calling as easy as ordering pizza (and probably more reliable than your local pizza place's delivery time estimates). It handles all the scary WebRTC stuff so you don't have to learn what an ICE candidate is or why STUN servers exist.

## Features

- **One-to-One Video Calls**: Because group calls are just organized chaos
- **Camera Switching**: Front camera for selfies, back camera for "professional" calls
- **Mute/Unmute**: For when your cat decides to perform an opera
- **Auto Permission Handling**: We'll ask nicely for camera and mic access
- **WebSocket Signaling**: Real-time communication that actually works
- **High Quality Video**: Up to 1080p (if your internet doesn't hate you)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure your `build.gradle` (Module: app) includes VideoCore Module



### Permissions

Add these permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

*Pro tip: The library will check permissions for you, but Android still requires you to declare them. It's like telling your mom you'll clean your room - you still have to actually do it.*

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize VideoCore

```java
// Start a video call - it's that simple!
VideoCore.start(context, "user123", "user456");
```

### 2. Get Video Views

```java
VideoCore videoCore = VideoCore.getInstance(context);

// Get local video view (your beautiful face)
View localVideoView = videoCore.getLocalVideoView();

// Get remote video view (their hopefully beautiful face)
View remoteVideoView = videoCore.getRemoteVideoView();

// Add them to your layout
yourLayout.addView(localVideoView);
yourLayout.addView(remoteVideoView);
```

### 3. Control the Call

```java
// Toggle camera (because sometimes you need the back camera)
boolean isFrontCamera = videoCore.toggleCamera();

// Toggle mute (for those "can you hear me now?" moments)
boolean isMuted = videoCore.toggleMute();

// End call (when the conversation gets awkward)
videoCore.endCall();
```

## Configuration

### Server URL

The library connects to `wss://comzy.io:8443` by default. If you're running your own signaling server (look at you, being all self-sufficient), you'll need to modify the `SIGNALING_SERVER_URL` constant in the VideoCore class.

You can find the signaling server implementation here:
üëâ [Signaling Server Repository](https://github.com/Comzy-io/Video-Call-Signaling-Server)

```java
private static final String SIGNALING_SERVER_URL = "wss://your-awesome-server.com:8443";
```

### Video Quality

Default settings:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (because pixels matter)
- **FPS**: 30 (smooth like butter)
- **Bitrate**: 2.5 Mbps max (adjust based on your internet speed)

Want to change these? Look for these constants in VideoCore:

```java
private static final int VIDEO_RESOLUTION_WIDTH = 1920;
private static final int VIDEO_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT = 1080;
private static final int FPS = 30;
```

## Architecture

The library follows the "make it work, then make it pretty" philosophy:

1. **WebSocket Connection**: Handles signaling with the server
2. **PeerConnection**: The WebRTC magic happens here
3. **Media Tracks**: Audio and video streams management
4. **UI Integration**: SurfaceViewRenderer for video display

## Error Handling

The library handles common errors gracefully:

- **Permission Denied**: We'll log it and cry internally
- **Camera Not Available**: Probably because another app is using it (looking at you, Instagram)
- **Network Issues**: We'll try our best, but we can't fix your WiFi
- **Peer Connection Failures**: Sometimes the internet gods are not in your favor

## Troubleshooting

### "Video call not connecting"
- Check your internet connection (yes, really)
- Make sure the signaling server is running
- Verify both users are using different userIds (you can't call yourself, that's just sad)

### "No video showing"
- Check camera permissions
- Try switching cameras
- Make sure you added the video views to your layout (rookie mistake)

### "No audio"
- Check microphone permissions
- Try toggling mute/unmute
- Check if your device is on silent (we've all been there)

### "App crashes on start"
- Make sure you have WebRTC dependency added
- Check if you're running on a real device (emulator support is... questionable)
